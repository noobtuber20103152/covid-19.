                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

                <p>The name "coronavirus" is derived from Latin <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corona#Latin" style="color: blue;">corona</a>, meaning "crown" or "wreath", itself a borrowing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus">Greek</a> κορώνη korṓnē, "garland, wreath".

The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)">Nature</a> to designate the new family of viruses. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus#Structure">virions</a> (the infective form of the virus) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope">electron microscopy</a>, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_corona">solar corona</a> or halo.

                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 32.2 million confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 574,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the sixteenth-highest per capita worldwide. The U.S. has about one fifth of the world's cases and deaths. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than died during both World Wars and the Vietnam War combined. COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.8 years in 2019 to 77.8 years in the first half of 2020.

The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia. As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 195,123 deaths as of 26 April 2021. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.

The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020, when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus. The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by 21 March. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its 1 millionth case; at this time, there had been nearly 49,000 reported deaths. As of April, Brazil, with over 14 million confirmed cases and over 390,000 deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only the United States and India.

            <h3>EMERGING MUTANTS</h3>
            <p>One of the reasons for the spread of the infection is the emerging mutants - both imported and homegrown. “A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 per cent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge,” virologists Shahid Jameel told news agency PTI.</p>

            <p>we endorse population density as a catalyst factor for the proliferation of COVID-19 in Algeria. We are interested in the relationship between population density and the spread of COVID-19 in Algerian cities. The latter is characterized by a disparity in the concentration of the population according to the geographic location of each</p>

            <h3> SOCIAL DISTANCE</h3>
            <p>Study shows that if we are at a distance of six feet, even then there is a chance of a Covid positive person transmitting the virus to an uninfected person. You can find this situation at home in case of home isolation cases.Couple this with a six feet distance between two people, then there is negligible risk of the spread of the infection across two people.</p>
